**Why?** After embedding data I want to explore the embedding space, which typically involves three things. First, interactive view adjustments like panning & zooming or changing the point size and opacity. Second, selecting instances. And third, coloring the embedded instances by a categorical or numerical value. The goal of jupyter-scatterplot is to easily support all three things and scale to millions of points.

**How?** Internally, jupyter-scatterplot is using [`regl-scatterplot`](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/)

## Development

**Requirements:**

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) >= 4.8

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flekschas/jupyter-scatterplot/ jupyter-scatterplot && cd jupyter-scatterplot
conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate jupyter-scatterplot
make install
```
