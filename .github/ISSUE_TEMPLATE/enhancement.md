You have an idea how to enhance Jupyter Scatter? That's awesome!

Before you file your idea, please:

- [ ] Check for duplicate issues.
- [ ] Describe the feature's goal, motivating use cases, its expected behavior, and impact.
- [ ] If you are proposing a new API, please explain how the current APIs fail to support your goal.
- [ ] If you are proposing to change an existing API, please explain if your proposed is backward compatible or incompatible.
- [ ] If applicable, include screenshots, GIFs, videos, or working examples.

You are encouraged to prototype multiple alternative APIs or implementation approaches for your proposed feature. Doing so often leads to a better solution.
